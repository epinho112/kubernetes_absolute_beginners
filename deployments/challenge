1 - Run the following Deployment template
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: deployment
        metadata:
        name: myapp-deployment
        labels:
            tier: frontend
            app: nginx
        spec:
        selector:
            matchLabels:
            app: myapp
        replicas: 3
        template:
            metadata:
            name: nginx-2
            labels:
                app: myapp
            spec:
            containers:
                - name: nginx
                image: nginx
1.1 - What was wrong with the template? if you still did not figure it out use this command [kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>]. Check the 'kind' section.
1.2 Fix the template and create a deployment

2 - Create a Deployment with the following parameters

name: frontend
replicas: 3
image: httpd:2.4-alpine
